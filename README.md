#Project Description

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of employee turnover data to uncover the key drivers behind attrition rates within the company. Our investigation revealed significant disparities across departments, highlighted salary discrepancies, and identified nuanced turnover patterns related to employee tenure. Additionally, we went beyond descriptive analysis by comparing the predictive capabilities of two prominent models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. This comprehensive approach not only provided valuable insights into the factors influencing turnover but also offered actionable information for strategic decision-making to enhance employee retention and organizational stability.

#Problem Statement

The project's goal is to study why employees leave the company. By looking at data about employees who have left, we want to find out what factors make them decide to go. This will help us figure out how to keep more employees happy and stay with the company

#Insights Found 

Sales Department Challenges: Many employees work in Sales, but they leave the company more often than others. This might mean there are problems specific to the Sales Department, like high-pressure targets or job dissatisfaction.

Safety Concerns: Workplace incidents lead to many employees leaving, indicating that better safety measures are needed. If employees feel unsafe, they're more likely to look for other jobs.

Low Salaries: A lot of employees earn low salaries, which could be why they leave. When people feel they aren't paid enough, they might leave to find better-paying jobs.

Tenure and Turnover: Employees often leave after about five years, which could show problems with career growth or feeling burnt out.

Limited Growth Opportunities: Few employees have been promoted recently, suggesting there aren't many chances to grow within the company. When employees feel stuck, they might leave to find better opportunities elsewhere.
